This repository has two projects:-

1. Final project: 
This contains the code and documentation of  a predictive classification model to predict the probability of crash i.e. 
to classify crash into “Y” (crash) and “N” (no crash) based upon the topic and sentiment analysis from the description 
provided in the dataset as well as using other attributes such as Make, Model, Cruise, Crash, mph and mileage.

2. Mid-term:
This contains the code and documentation of a predictive classification model to predict whether the customer defaults on 
credit card balance or not based on the data related to the customer providing his/her education, age, monthly bill, 
marital status etc.

Both the projects were done in both Python and SAS Eminer and has the source codes for both of these.
